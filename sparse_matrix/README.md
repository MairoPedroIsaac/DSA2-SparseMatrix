## Description
This project implements a sparse matrix class in JavaScript. The class allows for efficient storage and retrieval of non-zero elements in a sparse matrix format. It reads data from a text file and constructs a sparse matrix accordingly. The project includes functionality for adding, subtracting, and multiplying sparse matrices.

## Features
- Load sparse matrices from a text file.
- Retrieve elements from the sparse matrix.
- Set elements in the sparse matrix.
- Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on matrices.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
